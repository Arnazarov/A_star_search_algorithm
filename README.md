# A_star_search_algorithm

Problem: Finding the best path in a map with distance routes and coordinates using A* search algorithm.

Objective: This program finds the cheapest path between any given two cities using heuristic function

Running the program: The program must be run by executing python final_project.py
“filename1” “filename2” “start city” “goal city” where filename1 is the full path of a file with
city distances and filename2 is the full path of a file with city coordinates.

Example: python final_project.py “city_costs.txt” “city_coordinates.txt” “Arad” “Bucharest”.

If relative paths do not work, try entering full path of a file.
